Get the reader/viewer to click to read more.

Viral Tweet Thread Example #1
Principles this thread uses & why they worked:
Strong declarative sentence + controversial opinion opener.
"I you use it right, Twitter is the most powerful platform in the world." This sentence makes a bold claim that is somewhat controversial. Most readers will disagree with that first sentence, which will cause them to keep reading.
Twist the knife. "But Twitter does a horrible job showing you Its advanced features. you probably know nothing about." This sentence tells the reeder: "you're missing out on some awesome stuff. But it's not your fault, and i'm here to help."
The first sentence hooked them and the second sentence got them wanting more of what feels like "insider info." Clear, not clever. "Here are 10 of them you probably know nothing about." As clear as it gets - I am making a promise to the reader that what follows are 10 features they don't know about (scratching the itch and solving the problem I laid out in the 2nd sentence):
This is a classic "insider info secrets" listicle you can use time and time again. Tell the reader you have some insider Into (and how the world has conspired against them to keep them from knowing about it). Then ease their pain by giving them the insider info in a concise listicle format.
